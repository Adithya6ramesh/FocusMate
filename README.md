##  How it Works ?
1. Start the **Pomodoro timer** (25/5, 45/10, 60/15) from the Chrome extension.  
2. During the timer, the extension logs your active tab URLs and sends them to the FastAPI backend.  
3. The backend classifies sites as **productive / unproductive** and stores the stats.  
4. At the end of the day (Finish button), the app shows:  
   - Total productive hours  
   - Productivity percentage  
   - Comparison with yesterday  
   - Motivational quote
